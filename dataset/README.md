# Dataset
Aurras' dataset comprises of a list of requests with intent & entity labels.  The dataset is generated from the `./raw` directory's contents, with the `*_labels.json` and `train.pkl` file being generated by `Aurras/core/data_processing.py/generate_dataset`. 

If adding new intents, only a few samples are required to overfit the model and get it to classify similar requests. For more complex intents, more examples will be required.  The intents shouldn't need to be comprehensive, since as far as I've tested DistilBert seems to be able to generalize without much difficulty.
