# Project Aurras
Project Aurras is a virtual assistant I am building using intent classification and entity extraction.  This project's goals are to
1. Be able to understand direct and contextual commands
2. Be able to hold natural conversation
3. Be able to interact with extral APIs (IE turning on lights)

##Currently Project Aurras has two components, with two more being developed.

###Intent Classification
Intent classification is how Aurras understands what you want her to do.  By analyzing sentences she classifies each prompt into a single intent.  Then, based on this intent, she can preform different actions.  See my article on [intent classification](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/building-a-personal-ai-assistant-part-2-afb26c2a3b5b) for more information.
